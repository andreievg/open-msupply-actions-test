This is unofficial MacOS sqlite built of omSupply intended for demonstration, testing and other internal purposes.

Double click on open_msupply.sh to run the app, you will need to allow this app to run in System Settings -> Privacy & Security -> Security. Successfull start should launch omSupply in browser window.

The folder name is written in this format: omSupply_mac_{ARCHITECHTURE}_{VERSION}_{COMMIT_DAY_MONTH}_{COMMIT_HOUR_AND_SECOND}. Even though version is included in the build, intermediary builds can be created, thus the need for differentiation via commit date and time. There is also a file call sha.txt, which can be usefull to developers when reporting a bug (to narrow on on exact version).

Configuration files are located in configurations folder, they can be used to adjust settings, like port, database name etc.. App needs to be restarted after configurations have changed.

Some builds come with bundled data, please contact devs or project managers if you unsure what the user credentials are.

If you want to re-initialise omSupply from mSupply central server after it's already been initialised (either manually or through bundled demo data) you can either remove omsupply-database file, or change database_name in configurations/base.yaml

Common Problems:

'Error: Os { code: 48, kind: AddrInUse, message: "Address already in use" }' -> omSupply is likely already running, close all terminals and try again, or launch in a different port, see configurations above
